# Facebook PyTorch Developer Conference

In barely 2 short years, PyTorch (Facebook) will be hosting their first [PyTorch Developer Conference](https://pytorch.fbreg.com) in San Francisco, USA.

<!-- more -->

I will be heading down thanks to Soumith Chintala for the invite and arrangements. Looking forward to meet anyone there. 

The PyTorch ecosystem has grown tremendously from when I first started using it. To this date, I've taught more than 3000 students worldwide in 120+ countries and every single wizard has fallen in love with it!

Cheers,
