# Deep Learning Demystified, Defence and Science Technology Agency (DSTA)

I gave an introductory talk on deep learning to more than 1000 students at [BrainHack held by DSTA in June 2019](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/first-brainhack-event-incorporating-ai-and-cyber-security-elements-draws-1500-students).

I'm really excited for Singapore's progress in leveraging on deep learning for the defense sector. There are a lot of applications and areas of research.
