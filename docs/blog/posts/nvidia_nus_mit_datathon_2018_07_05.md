# NVIDIA Workshop at NUS-MIT-NUHS Datathon 

The NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI) trains developers, data scientists, and researchers on how to use artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems across a wide range of domains. In the deep learning courses, you’ll learn how to train, optimize, and deploy neural networks using the latest tools, frameworks, and techniques for deep learning.

In “Image Classification with DIGITS” mini-course, you will learn how to train a deep neural network to recognize handwritten digits by loading image data into a training environment, choosing and training a network, testing with new data, and iterating to improve performance.
