# Apache Cassandra

=== "Tools You Will Learn To Use"
    - Apache Cassandra

## Reasons for Using Apache Cassandra
- It is is an open-source NoSQL database management system (DBMS) that is designed to handle large amounts of data across many servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. 
    - Meaning if one server fails, everything goes as per normal as data is shared amongst nodes (servers).
    - Compared to other master/slave models like MongoDB, Cassandra has a master-less model.
- It has extremely fast read/write speeds.
    - You read/write millions of rows of data easily.
